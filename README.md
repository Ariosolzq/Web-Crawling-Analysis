# Web-Crawling-Analysis
# Beijing Second-Hand Housing Market Data Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of Beijing's second-hand housing market. Using data extracted from the Lianjia website, it examines the relationship between house prices and various influencing factors such as location, floor plan types, and community facilities. The project utilizes advanced statistical methods, including linear and ridge regression, for its predictive analysis. A detailed project flowchart is also provided to facilitate a better understanding of the data processing and analysis stages.
